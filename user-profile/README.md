# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description

This project is a React-based Profile Management Application. It allows users to manage their profile by entering details such as name, surname, job title, phone, email, and more. Users can upload an avatar, save the profile data to localStorage, and retrieve it after a page refresh. Additionally, users can manage projects and tasks using a card-based interface.


Features

1.Profile Form:

Fields for name, surname, job title, phone, email, address, and more.
File upload for avatar with live preview.
Save button to store data in localStorage.
Cancel button to clear fields and remove data from localStorage.
Data persists across page reloads.

2.Projects and Tasks Management:

Separate cards for managing projects and tasks.
Card interface with a customizable title and content.

3.Reusable Components:

CardComponent for project and task management.
Header for a consistent top navigation bar.

4.State Management:

Managed by zustand for centralized profile data control.

5.Form Validation:

Zod and React Hook Form for schema-based validation and error handling.


Libraries Used

1.React: Main library for building the user interface.

2.React Hook Form: Simplifies form state and validation.


3.Zod: Schema-based validation for form inputs.


4.@hookform/resolvers: Integrates Zod with React Hook Form.
